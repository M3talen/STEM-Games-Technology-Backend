For given `m` boxes a robot fills or empties them in a predefined pattern. The robot moves from the first box to the last and then backwards, each of which represents an iteration. In the i-th iteration, the robot stops at every i-th box and inspects its contents. If the box is empty, it places an object in it, otherwise it removes the object from it. All boxes are empty at the beginning. Find the number of boxes containing an object after `n` iterations.

The input represents values `m` and `n` separated by a space.

The output should be one value representing the number of boxes that contain an object.
